# Practice-with-Development-Technologies-Homework-2

This is our 'hello world' demo app with our chosen framework, Python Django. We are using Django 1.10

We will use AngularJS for our front end framework.

The app is essentially a wikipedia for Team ASE. There is a homepage, with a
list of all of us, and when you click on each page, you can see bits about us.
There is also an Edit button where anyone can edit the information, and submit
it. Data will be submitted and stored in a text file.
