## Hello!
This is our 'hello world' demo app with our chosen framework, Python Django. We are using Django 1.10

We will use AngularJS for our front end framework.

The app is essentially a wikipedia for Team Ether. There is a homepage, with a
list of all of us, and when you click on each page, you can see bits about us.
Once you click on one of our names, you will go to the page for that person.  You will see their bio; you can edit this bio by pressing the edit checkbox.  A text box will come up, and you can edit, and save, the bio. Data will be submitted and stored in a text file. To run, navigate to /Practice-with-Development-Technologies-Homework-2/toy_system/ and then type "python manage.py runserver". Open a web browser and navigate to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/"
